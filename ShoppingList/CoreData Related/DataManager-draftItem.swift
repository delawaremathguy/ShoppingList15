	// this gives me a way to collect all the data for an Item that i might want to edit
	// (or even just display).  it defaults to having values appropriate for a new item upon
	// creation, and can be initialized from a Item.  this is something
	// i can then hand off to an edit view.  at some point, that edit view will
	// want to update an Item with this data, so see the class function
	// Item.update(using draftItem: DraftItem)

	// ADDED 2 FEB 2022: this is now a class object that conforms to ObservableObject, with
	// five of its properties marked @Published (these are exactly the properties that can be edited
	// in the DraftItemView).  both the AddNewItemView and the ModifyExistingDataView
	// will create these as a @StateObject.  it turns out that @State (for a struct) and @StateObject
	// (for a class) do not exactly have the same behaviour, despite my naive belief that they did.
	// making this change solves an updating problem discovered while editing Items, where
	// some changes would "not seem to stick" across multiple edits.

		// the id of the Item, if any, associated with this data collection
		// (nil if data for a new item that does not yet exist)

	@Published var location: Location
	@Published var onList: Bool = true

	var dateText = "" // for display only, not actually editable
	
		// this copies all the editable data from an incoming Item.  this looks fairly
		// benign, but its in the lines below that crashes did/could occur in earlier versions
		// because of the main, underlying problem: if an item is deleted somewhere outside
		// a view showing a list of items, the list view may wind up calling this with an item
		// that's a zombie: the data behind it has been deleted, but it could still be present
		// as a fault in Core Data.  i still don't quite get this -- it has to do
		// with how SwiftUI updates views.

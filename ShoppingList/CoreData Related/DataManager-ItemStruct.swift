	// handed out to the ShoppingListView and the PurchasedItemView so that
	// we do not expose real core data objects and their dependencies to associated
	// Locations to these views.
	// this type of struct is also used by an EditViewModel when editing an item (well,
	// editing an ItemStruct representation of an Item), although the last three properties
	// associated with its location (name, color, visitationOrder) have no use in this case.

		// backs this data in Core Data (so we can find it later)

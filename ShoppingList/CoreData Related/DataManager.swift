/* Discussion
 
 this implementation of a DataManager (DM) started off as a trial balloon, based on an issue
 opened by @santi-g-s (Santiago Garcia Santos) of how one might go about adding
 XCTesting to a project such as this.  (the major impediment to easily adding testing
 was the app's use of a global singleton.)

the DataManagerClass now becomes the base-level data model for SL15.
   - it owns the Core Data stack (the stack is no longer in a global singleton)
 -  it acts as a centralized replacement of  multiple, distributed @FetchRequests by
      using NSFetchResultsControllers instead for Items and Locations
 - it vends an array of Items and and an array of Locations
 - it handles all requests to add and delete Core Data objects
 - it handles all other data requests involving Items and Locations that go beyond
       simple reading of Item and Location property values.
 
you will see that what were class functions originally defined on Item and Location
 are here; and you'll also see that all the "fronting" variables i use on Item
 and Location are now read-only -- SwiftUI views no longer have authority to
 write to Items and Locations, but instead must go through this DM to make
 those changes.
 
 for the future: one far-flung thought i'll look at is that the DM will not vend any
 actual Core Data objects, but instead will vend structs that are representations
 of those objects.  if that idea works, then SwiftUI would suddenly be
 very happy, since everything the views see would be structs and not (class) objects.

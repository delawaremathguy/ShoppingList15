/*
 the app will hold an object of type Today, which keeps track of the "start of today."
 the PurchasedItemsView needs to know what "today" means to properly section out
 its data, and it might seem to you that the PurchasedItemsView could handle that by
 itself.  however, if you push the app into the background when the PurchasedItemsView
 is showing and then bring it back a few days later, the PurchasedItemsView will show
 the same display as when it went into the background and not know about the change;
 so its view will need to be updated.  that's why this is here: the app certainly
 knows when it becomes active, and can update what "today" means, and the
 PurchasedItemsView will pick up on that in its environment
 */
class Today: ObservableObject {
	@Published var start: Date = Calendar.current.startOfDay(for: Date())
	
	func update() {
		let newStart = Calendar.current.startOfDay(for: Date())
		if newStart != start {
			start = newStart
		}
	}
}

// this is the new App structure for iOS 14.  it pushes the managedObjectContext of the
// singleton (global) PersistentStore into the environment of the MainView -- this makes
// sure that all the @FetchRequests will work.  it pushes a Today object into the environment,
// primarily for the PurchasedItemsView.  and it applies the .onReceive modifiers
// to the MainView to watch being moved into and out of the background

// as an alternative structure, consider the comments on the Apple Developer Forums in this thread
//     https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/650876
// which suggests watching for changes to the Scene, rather than hooking into the NotificationCenter

@main
struct ShoppingListApp: App {
	
	@StateObject var dataManager = DataManager()
		// we create the date object that defines the meaning of "today"
	@StateObject var today = Today()

		WindowGroup {
			MainView()
				//.environment(\.managedObjectContext, persistentStore.context)
				.environmentObject(dataManager)
				.environmentObject(today)

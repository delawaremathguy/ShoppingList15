// this is a simple struct to extract only the fields of an Item
// that we would import or export in such a way that the result is Codable.
// there's some assumption here that location names are unique, because
// by representing an Item in JSON for the purpose of getting a snapshot
// of the data and then later reload that snapshot, we're asking that the
// item can be later hooked back up  to its Location by the location's name.
